## Description:
Sample app made with the intention to show Clean Architecture and good practices.

I didn't implement DataSources due to I have just a source of data which is an API.
I didn't put the sizes in resources, but all we know that the sizes must be in the resources.
Because of time, I could make mistakes in some good practices but in general, I think the Clean Architecture is well implemented, for the presentation module (App module) I used MVP architecture.
